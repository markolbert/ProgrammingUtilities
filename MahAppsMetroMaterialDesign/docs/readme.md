# J4JSoftware.WPFUtilities.MaterialDesign

My recent WPF apps have generally used [MahApps.Metro](https://mahapps.com/) and its [related material design extensions](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) because the resulting UI looks a bit more modern (to my eyes, at least) than the WPF default.

This assembly targets Net 7 and has nullability enabled.

The library repository is available on [github](https://github.com/markolbert/ProgrammingUtilities/blob/master/docs/mahappsmatdesign.md).

The change log is [available here](changes.md).

It provides some XAML resources which I've found helpful:

- **CustomComboBox.xaml** supports displaying error messages more neatly than is the case with the default WPF combobox control.
- **MaterialDesignDropDownButton.xaml** provides a somewhat nicer looking dropdown button than the one provided by the MahApps material design library.
