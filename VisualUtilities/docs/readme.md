# J4JSoftware.VisualUtilities

The change log is [available here](changes.md).

The library repository is available on [github](https://github.com/markolbert/ProgrammingUtilities/blob/master/docs/visual-utils.md).

This assembly is focused on functions needed to work with various kinds of media objects.

This assembly targets Net 7 and has nullability enabled.

It contains a simple support class for working with "web-encoded" colors, `WebColors`. By "web-encoded" I mean RGB colors which are stored in a different sequence within a 32 bit integer than is the Microsoft/Windows norm. An example is the encoding used by Google Earth.

Remaining documentation forthcoming...
