## Programming Utilities
A collection of utilities used in [J4JSoftware](https://www.jumpforjoysoftware.com)
projects.

### TL;DR
All these assemblies target Net5 and have nullability enabled.

All the assemblies are licensed under the GNU GPL-v3 (or later). See the 
[license file](LICENSE.md) for more details.

Because one of libraries (`TopologicalSort`) is in flux and I've yet to figure
out how to use git to cherrypick stuff please visit the **dev** branch to see
the documentation on these libraries.
