# J4JSoftware.DeusEx

`DeusEx` is an abstraction of dependency injection which provides a static DI resolver. By including it in a program and configuring it you can use the `IServiceProvider` interface anywhere in your code, access an `IJ4JLogger` logging facility during program startup, etc.

`DeusEx` is designed to work with `J4JHostBuilder`, my implementation of the `IHostBuilder`/`IHost` system. For details on `J4JHostBuilder` please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/markolbert/ProgrammingUtilities/blob/master/docs/dependency/dependency.md).
