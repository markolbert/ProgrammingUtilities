# MahApps.Metro Material Design XAML Resources

My recent WPF apps have generally used [MahApps.Metro](https://mahapps.com/) and its [related material design extensions](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) because the resulting UI looks a bit more modern (to my eyes, at least) than the WPF default.

This assembly provides some XAML resources which I've found helpful:

- **CustomComboBox.xaml** supports displaying error messages more neatly than is the case with the default WPF combobox control.
- **MaterialDesignDropDownButton.xaml** provides a somewhat nicer looking dropdown button than the one provided by the MahApps material design library.
