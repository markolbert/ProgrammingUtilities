# MahApps.Metro Material Design XAML Resources

## Changes

|Version|Summary of Changes|
|-------|------------------|
|1.1|updated to Net 6|
|1.0.1|added nuget readme|
|1.0|initial release|

My recent WPF apps have generally used [MahApps.Metro](https://mahapps.com/) and its [related material design extensions](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) because the resulting UI looks a bit more modern (to my eyes, at least) than the WPF default.

This assembly targets Net 6 and has nullability enabled. It provides some XAML resources which I've found helpful:

- **CustomComboBox.xaml** supports displaying error messages more neatly than is the case with the default WPF combobox control.
- **MaterialDesignDropDownButton.xaml** provides a somewhat nicer looking dropdown button than the one provided by the MahApps material design library.
