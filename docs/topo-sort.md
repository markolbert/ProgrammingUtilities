## Topological Sort
This assembly provides:

- an implementation of a topological sort. These are sorts where the order
is implicit in how the objects depend on each other. A common example is
determining the build order for a multi-project solution when it's
compiled.
- collections of classes which perform actions which must be performed
in a topologically-sorted sequence.

This assembly targets Net5 and has nullability enabled.
