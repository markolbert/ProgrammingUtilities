# Visual Utilities

This assembly is focused on functions needed to work with various kinds of media objects.

This assembly targets Net 6 and has nullability enabled.

It currently has only one class, a collection of static and extension methods for working with "web-encoded" colors. By "web-encoded" I mean RGB colors which are stored in a different sequence within a 32 bit integer than is the Microsoft/Windows norm. An example is the encoding used by Google Earth.
