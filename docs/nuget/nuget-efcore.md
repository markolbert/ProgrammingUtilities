# Entity Framework Utilities

This assembly provides two capabilities to simplify using Entity Frameowork Core in projects:

- Simplifies setting up a **design-time factory** for instances of `DbContext` to use during development.
- Provides a way of associating **entity configuration information** with the entity being configured when you're using a fluent design approach.

This assembly targets Net 6 and has nullability enabled.
