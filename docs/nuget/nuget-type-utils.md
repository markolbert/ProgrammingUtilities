# Type Utilities

Provides mechanisms for filtering types during dependency injection registration. While developed to work with [Autofac](https://www.autofac.org) the filtering routines should work with other DI frameworks as well.

Check [the GitHub documentation](https://github.com/markolbert/ProgrammingUtilities) for more details. That same link also provides documentation of how these utilities are used by my Autofac-based DI/`IHost` library.
