# Miscellaneous Utilities

This assembly provides two APIs which I've found helpful in building WPF apps, particularly ones that utilize 
[SyncFusion's WPF controls](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls):

| API | Description |
|-----|-------------|
|SelectableNode|provides a wrapper for selecting nodes that are used in a tree control|
|RangeCalculator|provides a means for selecting a reasonable pair of major/minor tick intervals for a range control|

This assembly targets Net 6 and has nullability enabled.

For further information consult the [github documentation](https://github.com/markolbert/ProgrammingUtilities/blob/master/docs/miscutils/miscutils.md).

Examples of using both APIs are forthcoming, assuming I ever finish writing a living expense Monte Carlo simulator I've been working on :).
